# SuperbSurvivorsContinued

## All original code credits goes to the original creators, Ryuu and nolanritchie*
The code files in this repo are based on the Steam workshop item as of April 25, 2023.

Original GitHub repo:

Since there has no updates for months and I felt this was too much to be abandoned to rot, I have decide to do what I can to make NPCs viable in PZ.

* *At least until whenever the official NPCs are added to the game.*

## *It is important to know there were many other authors and creators who have contributed (unknowingly) to Superb Survivors.*  
### If you believe your work was used in this mod, please reach out and we can work to resolve your issues.
PZ has a declared policy on modding: https://projectzomboid.com/blog/modding-policy/

* Based on the current code review of the workshop item, I have found some of the referencing functions from other mods but were uncredited.  
* *__This "Continuation" fork of "Superb Survivors!" will be removing any non-essential referenced mods and referenced workshop items, as their original authors likely never granted permission and I wish to respect them.__*

## Here are the workshop items I have found, but were uncredited
* Brita's Mod - ... too many to list in the workshop, I can't find which one Superb Survivors was referencing and it broke a few things on spawning npcs.  
  * I have attempted to remove all references to Brita's. If you spot it in the code, please notify me so it can be removed.  
* ORGM - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=514618604 by Fenris Wolf  
* Subpar Survivors - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2521330369 by SlightlyMadMan

## What will be done in this mod?
In this "Continuation", I will attempt to fix the known (and unknown) issues while updating the core functionalities.  

* Beyond that, I will also attempt to look at what can be rewritten so that other mods may use it and extended to their own mods.  
* ***Don't expect any new features such as a quest system or storyboard.***  

## Why no new features?
* A functional NPC spawning framework is all I plan for this continuation.
* The intention is to make this mod extensible, so that others can continue to work on their own things as they please without worrying about breakage and overlaps.  
* There are already many issues with the mod itself that it is questionable all of the issues can be fixed.

In other words, I don't have the time nor will to make a "super" All-in-One platform mod with RPG quest support and a storyline.  

If you want to write a story and/or quest mod for a spawned NPC, go for it - but please to remember properly credit the referenced sources.  

### *The mod will be strictly based on vanilla PZ.*
* Hilltop Survivor Camp and other non-core functionalities (such as 3rd party mod compatibilities) will be removed.  
* The quest system, in whatever state it was in, will not be included either.  
* You can find the modded area by MayRum here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2132007014

*I am personally new to LUA scripting, if you are reading this and can help, please feel free to do so.*
